# WebRTC File Transfer

This project enables peer-to-peer file transfer using WebRTC, with a **Next.js client** and a **Golang signaling server** that communicates over WebSockets.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer file transfer using WebRTC
- WebSockets-based signaling mechanism
- Next.js frontend
- Golang backend for signaling

## Environment Variables

### Client (Next.js)

Create a `.env.local` file inside the `client` directory and define the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL=ws://localhost:5001/ws
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL` â†’ WebSocket server for signaling.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL` â†’ The frontend URL.

### Signaling Server (Golang)

Set up environment variables in your Go server or use a `.env` file (if applicable):

```
SIGNALING_SERVER_PORT=5001
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for Next.js frontend)
- **Go** (for signaling server)

### 1. Run the Signaling Server

```sh
cd signaling_server
go run main.go
```

By default, the server runs on `ws://localhost:5001/ws`.

### 2. Run the Next.js Client

```sh
cd client
npm install   # Install dependencies
npm run dev   # Start the development server
```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

1. The Next.js frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the signaling server.
2. When a user joins, the signaling server manages peer connections.
3. WebRTC data channels are used to transfer files directly between peers.

## TODOs & Improvements

- [âœ…] Checkin if peer left
- [âœ…] Add Download limit feature (Currently no limit until sender is online)
- [âœ…] Sending to multiple peers
- [âœ…] Add Password protection

- [] Add password encryption and decryption
- [] Add file encryption and decryption

## Contributing

## Awesome features to be implemented

     Browser-Based P2P Transfer Even if the Sender Leaves

    ðŸ’¡ If the sender closes the tab, most WebRTC-based P2P transfers fail.
    ðŸ›  Solution: Implement Service Workers + Shared WebRTC Peers so the transfer can continue even after the sender disconnects.

    "Secret File Sharing Rooms" With Temporary Usernames

    ðŸ’¡ P2P tools usually require linksâ€”not ephemeral rooms.
    ðŸ›  Solution: Let people create anonymous file-sharing rooms where users get random names like "BlueFox42" and can drop files without sign-up.
